# Subject

Write a web application in Scala that will ask the user for two actions : Query or Reports.

1.  [X] Query Option will ask the user for the country name or code and display the airports & runways at each airport.
    - [X] The input can be country code or country name.

2. [X] Choosing Reports will display the following (possibly through a menu):

    - [X] 10 countries with highest number of airports (with count) and countries  with lowest number of airports.
    - [X] Type of runways (as indicated in "surface" column) per country
    - [X] The top 10 most common runway latitude (indicated in "le_ident" column)
â€‹
If you get the job done (9pt) with a clean code (4pt), correct test coverage (2pt) you'll have up to 15.

### Optional Part
   - [X]  Use coursier (0.5pt)
   - [X]  In 2.2 make the name matching partial/fuzzy. e.g. entering zimb will result in Zimbabwe (2pt)
   - []  Use database (in memory for the exercice like h2,sqlite) (4pt)
   - []  Do a GUI (6pt)
   - []  provide a rest API (4pt)
   - []  Use Future to improve the speed of your app (2pt)
   - []  Same as 0.5 with parallel collection (1pt)
